Codebook for run_analysis.R:


1. Prep work:

	-Downloads .zip file from provided link
	-Unzips dataset into “UCI HAR Dataset” folder
	-Sets “UCI HAR Dataset” as working directory.


2. Assigns relevant data files to data frames (descriptions from “README.txt” provided in dataset):

	- features <- features.txt
		List of all features.

	- activities <- activities_labels.txt
		Links the class labels with their activity name.

	- subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt & subject_train <- train/subject_train.txt
		Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its 
		range is from 1 to 30.

	- x_train <- train/X_train.txt
		Training set.

	- y_train <- train/y_train.txt
		Training labels.

	- x_test <- test/X_test.txt
		Test set.

	- y_test <- test/y_test.txt
		Test labels.


3. Merges training and test datasets into one:

	- X
		Combines x_train and x_test using rbind().

	- Y 
		Combines y_train and y_test using rbind().

	- Subject 
		Combines subject_train and subject_test using rbind().

	- everything 
		Combines X, Y, and Subject using cbind().


4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:

	- means.devs
		Subsets everything (data frame) to include only columns “subject”, “code”, and any
		column whose name contains “mean” or “std”.


5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:

	- Assigns values of “code” column of means.devs to the appropriate corresponding
	  activity using activities (data frame) as a key.


6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names:

	- Uses gsub() to replace non-descriptive elements of column names from means.devs with
	  appropriate descriptive names:

		- "Acc" = "Accelerometer"
		- “Gyro” = "Gyroscope"
		- “BodyBody" = "Body"
		- “Mag" = "Magnitude"
		- “^t" (Starts with ’t’) = "Time"
		- “^f" (Starts with ’f’) = "Frequency"
	
	- Capitalizes each distinct portion of substrings in column names


7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
    variable for each activity and each subject:

	- grouped.data
		Data frame created by grouping means.devs by subject, then activity, then summarizing 
		means of each variable by those groupings.

8. Writes grouped.data to a .csv file called CompletedProject.csv.
